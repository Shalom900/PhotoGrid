# PhotoGrid

PhotoGrid is a responsive webpage for displaying images in an organized, grid-style layout. The site is tailored for ShalomTech and provides a seamless experience across multiple devices, with easy navigation and social media links.

## Project Structure

- **HTML**: The page is structured using HTML5 and Tailwind CSS classes, ensuring responsiveness across screen sizes.
- **CSS**: Styles are managed with Tailwind CSS, including customized classes for different breakpoints.
- **JavaScript**: Basic interactivity to toggle visibility of navigation links on smaller screens.

## Features

1. **Responsive Design**:
   - The layout adjusts for various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
   - Background and grid layouts use media-specific classes like `md`, `lg`, and custom breakpoints (e.g., `ipad-air-portrait`).

2. **Navigation**:
   - A header with navigation links (`Photos`, `Services`, `Contact`) and social media icons (`Instagram`, `Facebook`, `Twitter`).
   - On smaller screens, a toggle button (`#biggerBtn`) reveals the navigation links in a side panel (`#smallerScreen`).

3. **Grid Layout**:
   - Each image section is organized in a grid, with images and descriptions in a two-column layout on larger screens.

4. **Social Media Links**:
   - Icon buttons for social media platforms are implemented using Bootstrap Icons.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/photogrid.git
   cd photogrid
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - This project requires Tailwind CSS, Flatpickr (for date-related functionality), and Bootstrap Icons. If not using the CDN, you can install dependencies with npm:
   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss flatpickr bootstrap-icons
   ```

3. **Run the Project**:
   - Open `index.html` in a browser to view the project locally.

## Code Overview

- **HTML File**: Defines the structure and content of the webpage. The header includes a title and navigation links, while the main content consists of three primary grid sections (`Portraits`, `Cityscapes`, and additional sections).
  
- **CSS**:
   - External stylesheets are included for Bootstrap Icons and Flatpickr.
   - Tailwind CSS handles layout and responsive design, with custom classes for different breakpoints.

- **JavaScript**:
   - The `biggerBtn` button toggles visibility of the `smallerScreen` menu on smaller devices. Ensure there are no extra closing tags in the button code to avoid rendering issues.

## Known Issues

- **Closing Tags**: Ensure all `<div>` tags are properly closed to maintain layout structure.
- **Class Names**: Use valid Tailwind syntax (e.g., `md:w-[90vw]` instead of `md-w[90vw]`).

## Future Improvements

- Additional animations for smoother transitions on menu toggle.
- More descriptive alternative text for images to enhance accessibility.
